                                Instead of going home afterschool to play video games or going to the mall, ten students are spending their time in the <a href="http://www.layc-dc.org/">Latin American Youth Center</a> in Washington D.C. Students are meeting in the <a href="http://www.layc-dc.org/youth-corner/dc-teen-center/">Teen Center</a> and working together and creating art in the program “Mi Vida, Mi Voz.” The name of the program translates to “My Life, My Story.”
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                                This unique program encourages students to work together to combine art, photograph, and painting/drawing to create a story that reflects their lives and experiences growing up in the Hispanic or Latino community. This program also pairs groups with mentors who are students from the University of Maryland, such as myself.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                                I came across the opportunity to become a mentor for the program through flyer I found one day in the art department. I decided to apply because I wanted to become more active in my community through art – and I wanted an internship for my resume as well. I was accepted and trained to be a mentor. Three weeks of the program have passed, and I have seen how rewarding this job can be.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                                I could not have imagined the impact I have been able to make through helping the students create their project, and find their voice through art. As much as I have taught the students about art, they have taught me lessons of being courageous and prideful of my culture. As a first generation American, I did not embrace my Salvadorian roots. After this experience, I see the value of my heritage in my identity.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                                Currently, we are working to get ready for the upcoming final exhibit to showcase the student’s art. I have watched my mentees have worked hard and put a lot of effort into their art projects. 
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                                I hope that everyone in the D.C. and Maryland community will come out to the final exhibit on March 18, 2017. LAYC will also be accepting donations as the art exhibit event in order to fund the next session of the program Mi Vida, Mi Voz.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                                I am excited to come back again next fall semester as mentor, and also I hope other art college students will join to experience this amazing opportunity.
